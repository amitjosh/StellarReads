Vision

Create a 'Borderless Ecosystem' for readers, writers and publishers (both technical and non-technical) to get paid in Stellar XLM (or any other asset supported on the Stellar payments network) to read, write and share

Opportunity

To encourage more people to publish and read books online by creating a marketplace platform where you get paid to not only publish but also to read

Proposed Platform

On the platform, people registered as writers/publishers will put up a prologue for their book, for the new content they will write on or for the content written by them (proof for the same to be provided) to garner interest from potential readers. On reaching a threshold of subscription from readers, they will be guaranteed a certain payment (to be held in escrow) to begin writing their book or hosting their book (on any topic) on the Stellar Reads platform. The new content writers have the choice to release their book either chapter wise or section wise or the full book whereas the old content writers/publishers who own multiple content can use the platform to get readers to subscribe to their books or even buy it. Once a section of the book or the entire book is complete, they can put on the marketplace for readers to subscribe to reading or put it up for sale..

What’s in it for the writers/publishers/readers?

For writers/publishers: Access to a global payment system making it easier to process payments from readers anywhere in the world for hosting new as well as old (owned material) 

For readers: Quality reading material and incentivization for readers. More importantly, if they do would not like to continue reading the book after a specific number of chapters, they can unsubscribe thereby saving time and money.

What’s in it for Stellar?

Access to an unexplored global customer base of avid online book readers 


Market Sizing

Google Books estimates that there are about 130 million books in existence. If you double that, it's probably more than enough to cover all the books that ever existed. UNESCO estimates that about 2 million books are published worldwide each year, but that includes older books as well as new ones.

The reading community globally is huge and the market potential is high. An average person spends about 5-7 hours reading and reads 6-8 books, yearly on an average globally, with approximately more than 25% reading a combination of paper backed and online books with inclination to audio books and online books. Thus the market size adequate to start and later move towards others forms of content such as video, blogs, etc.

Business Model

1.	Subscription Model: For readers who want limited access to the material for a definite time period
2.	Buy/Sell Model: For readers who would like to add the book/publication to their reading library
3.	Incentivization: This can be a bit tricky and has to be deliberated cautiously.
  ●	Reading: Reader rewards to be deliberated with Proof of Reading protocol development to avoid paying out unnecessarily
  ●	Sharing: Any sharing by readers that results in enhanced revenue, the respective readers will be rewarded with a portion of the revenue generated

With the dual mode business model, we envision to cover a bigger market size. 

StellarReads will have a pay as you use business model. We will be charging a commission 2-5% from the sales on the platform apart from a nominal membership fee for platform quality maintenance. 

Proof of Writing/Publishing 

The work has to be original or be owned by the publisher - proof for the same has to be accorded. The curation of writing will be done in a decentralized manner by the community though (similar to how transactions are approved on the Stellar network) though decorum has to be maintained as per regulations to be set for the platform service usage.

Proof of Reading

The reader incentivization is an important part of the ecosystem. Thus apart from providing quality reading material, a protocol will be deliberated upon to payout rewards as per the readings done by the respective readers.
